       A program to convert a series of editable text GIF icon specifications
       and named GIF files into a multi-image GIF, usable as a graphic
       resource file. It can also dump existing GIFs in this format.

       If no GIF file is given, gifbuild will try to read a text input from
       stdin.

       Here is a syntax summary in informal BNF. The token `NL' represents a
       required newline.

       If the data types of the "screen height", "screen width", "screen
       background", "image top", and "image left" declarations aren't obvious
       to you, what are you doing with this software?

       The "pixel aspect byte" declaration sets an integer denominator for a
       fraction expressing the puxel aspect ratio. See the GIF standard for
       details; this field is actually long obsolete.

       A color table declares color indices (in ascending order from 0) and
       may associate them with key characters (these associations are absent
       when the map is more than 94 colors lang and raster blocks using it
       must use hex pairs). These characters can later be used in raster
       blocks. As these must be printable and non-whitespace, you can only
       specify 94 colors per icon. Life is like that sometimes.

       A color table declaration can also set the table's sort flag with "sort
       flag on" or "sort flag off" on any line before the end.

       An "ascii" raster block is just a block of key characters (used for a
       color map of 94 or fewer colors). A "hex" raster block uses hex digit
       pairs instead (used for a color map with more than 94 colors). The
       default is ASCII. It should be sized correctly for the "image bits"
       declaration that leads it. Raster blocks from interlaced GIFs are
       dumped with the lines in non-interlaced order.

       The "comment" or "plaintext" keywords lead defined GIF89 extension
       record data (the other two GIF89 types, graphics control and
       application block, are not yet supported). You can also say "extension"
       followed by a hexadecimal record type. All of these extension
       declarations must be followed by an extension block, which is
       terminated by the keyword "end" on its own line.

       An extension block is a series of text lines, each interpreted as a
       string of bytes to fill an extension block (the terminating newline is
       stripped). Text may include standard C-style octal and hex escapes
       preceded by a backslash.

       A graphics control block declaration creates a graphics control
       extension block; for the field semantics see the GIF89 standard, part
       23.

       A netscape loop declaration creates an application extension block
       containing a NETSCAPE 2.0 animation loop control with a specified
       repeat count (repeat count 0 means loop forever). This must be
       immediately after the header declaration. These loop blocks are
       interpreted by the Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox line of browsers.

       All <digits> tokens are interpreted as decimal numerals; <hex-digits>
       tokens are interpreted as two hex digits (a byte). All coordinates are
       zero-origin with the top left corner (0,0). Range checking is weak and
       signedness checking nonexistent; caveat hacker!

       In general, the amount of whitespace and order of declarations within a
       header or image block is not significant, except that a raster picture
       must immediately follow its "image bits" bits declaration.

       The "include" declaration includes a named GIF as the next image. The
       global color maps of included GIFs are merged with the base table
       defined by any "screen color" declaration. All images of an included
       multi-image GIF will be included in order.

       Comments may be preceded with "#" and will be ignored.
